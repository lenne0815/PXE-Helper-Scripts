Step 2: Configure SSH for Access
By default, root login and password authentication might be disabled in the container's SSH config.

Open the configuration file:

Bash

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
Modify the following lines (remove the # comment symbol if present):

To allow root login: Change PermitRootLogin to yes.

To allow passwords: Ensure PasswordAuthentication is set to yes.

Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X).

Restart the service to apply changes:

Bash

systemctl restart ssh
